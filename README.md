# Project Summary

This project analyzes student performance data using Python from . The notebook covers the following:

- **Data Loading:** Imports and explores the student performance dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes distributions and relationships between features such as gender, parental education, and test scores.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features to enhance analysis.
- **Modeling:** Applies machine learning models to predict student outcomes.
- **Results:** Evaluates model performance and interprets key findings.

The notebook provides insights into factors affecting student performance and demonstrates data science workflows from preprocessing to modeling.

# What I Learned
